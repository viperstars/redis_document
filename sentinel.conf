# Example sentinel.conf

# port <sentinel-port>
# The port that this sentinel instance will run on(sentinel的监听端口)
port 26379

# sentinel announce-ip <ip>（声明地址，适用于NAT环境，使非本地网络的redis的server通过此IP与sentinel通信）
# sentinel announce-port <port>（声明端口，适用于NAT环境，使非本地网络的redis的server通过此端口与sentinel通信）
#
# The above two configuration directives are useful in environments where,
# because of NAT, Sentinel is reachable from outside via a non-local address.
#
# When announce-ip is provided, the Sentinel will claim the specified IP address
# in HELLO messages used to gossip its presence, instead of auto-detecting the
# local address as it usually does.
#
# Similarly when announce-port is provided and is valid and non-zero, Sentinel
# will announce the specified TCP port.
#
# The two options don't need to be used together, if only announce-ip is
# provided, the Sentinel will announce the specified IP and the server port
# as specified by the "port" option. If only announce-port is provided, the
# Sentinel will announce the auto-detected local IP and the specified port.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel announce-ip 1.2.3.4

# dir <working-directory>（定义工作目录）
# Every long running process should have a well-defined working directory.
# For Redis Sentinel to chdir to /tmp at startup is the simplest thing
# for the process to don't interfere with administrative tasks such as
# unmounting filesystems.
dir /tmp

# sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <redis-port> <quorum>
#
# Tells Sentinel to monitor this master, and to consider it in O_DOWN （告知sentinel监测此master并认定在至少<quorum>也认为此master下线后，此master为客观下线）
# (Objectively Down) state only if at least <quorum> sentinels agree.
#
# Note that whatever is the ODOWN quorum, a Sentinel will require to
# be elected by the majority of the known Sentinels in order to
# start a failover, so no failover can be performed in minority.
#
# Slaves are auto-discovered, so you don't need to specify slaves in
# any way. Sentinel itself will rewrite this configuration file adding
# the slaves using additional configuration options.
# Also note that the configuration file is rewritten when a
# slave is promoted to master.
#
# Note: master name should not include special characters or spaces.
# The valid charset is A-z 0-9 and the three characters ".-_".
sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2

# sentinel auth-pass <master-name> <password>
#
# Set the password to use to authenticate with the master and slaves.（设定和master以及slave通信的密码）
# Useful if there is a password set in the Redis instances to monitor.
#
# Note that the master password is also used for slaves, so it is not
# possible to set a different password in masters and slaves instances
# if you want to be able to monitor these instances with Sentinel.
#
# However you can have Redis instances without the authentication enabled
# mixed with Redis instances requiring the authentication (as long as the
# password set is the same for all the instances requiring the password) as
# the AUTH command will have no effect in Redis instances with authentication
# switched off.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel auth-pass mymaster MySUPER--secret-0123passw0rd

# sentinel down-after-milliseconds <master-name> <milliseconds>
#
# Number of milliseconds the master (or any attached slave or sentinel) should（认为master主观下线的时间）
# be unreachable (as in, not acceptable reply to PING, continuously, for the
# specified period) in order to consider it in S_DOWN state (Subjectively
# Down).
#
# Default is 30 seconds.（默认30秒）
sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 30000

# sentinel parallel-syncs <master-name> <numslaves>
#
# How many slaves we can reconfigure to point to the new slave simultaneously（在故障转移过程中，有多少个slave可以并发的与master进行同步）
# How many slaves we can reconfigure to point to the new slave simultaneously（在故障转移过程中，有多少个slave可以并发的与master进行同步）
# during the failover. Use a low number if you use the slaves to serve query（如果希望在与mater同步过程中slave可以响应请求，那么就需要调低此值）
# to avoid that all the slaves will be unreachable at about the same
# time while performing the synchronization with the master.
sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1

# sentinel failover-timeout <master-name> <milliseconds>（故障转移超时时间）
#
# Specifies the failover timeout in milliseconds. It is used in many ways:
#
# - The time needed to re-start a failover after a previous failover was（在第一次故通过指定的Sentinel开始障转移后，重新启动故障转移需要两倍的时间）
#   already tried against the same master by a given Sentinel, is two
#   times the failover timeout.
#
# - The time needed for a slave replicating to a wrong master according（在slave根据现在的Sentienl的配置和一个错误的master同步后强制和正确的master同步的时间）
#   to a Sentinel current configuration, to be forced to replicate
#   with the right master, is exactly the failover timeout (counting since
#   the moment a Sentinel detected the misconfiguration).
#
# - The time needed to cancel a failover that is already in progress but（在发生了故障转移，但是在此过程中没有配置修改时需要取消此次故障转移的时间）
#   did not produced any configuration change (SLAVEOF NO ONE yet not
#   acknowledged by the promoted slave).
#
# - The maximum time a failover in progress waits for all the slaves to be（在故障转移后，等待所有slave被配置为新master的slave）
#   reconfigured as slaves of the new master. However even after this time
#   the slaves will be reconfigured by the Sentinels anyway, but not with
#   the exact parallel-syncs progression as specified.
#
# Default is 3 minutes.
sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000

# SCRIPTS EXECUTION
#
# sentinel notification-script and sentinel reconfig-script are used in order（在故障转移发生之后，sentinel会通过通知脚本和重新配置脚本来通知系统管理员重新配置客户端）
# to configure scripts that are called to notify the system administrator
# or to reconfigure clients after a failover. The scripts are executed
# with the following rules for error handling:
#
# If script exits with "1" the execution is retried later (up to a maximum（如果脚本返回值为1，稍后会重试执行脚本）
# number of times currently set to 10).
#
# If script exits with "2" (or an higher value) the script execution is（如果脚本的返回值为2或者更大值，那么脚本不会被重试）
# not retried.
#
# If script terminates because it receives a signal the behavior is the same（如果脚本收到信号被中断，也会返回1）
# as exit code 1.
#
# A script has a maximum running time of 60 seconds. After this limit is（脚本执行的最大时长为60秒，如果超过此时间，那么脚本会被SIGKILL信号kill并在一段时间后重试）
# reached the script is terminated with a SIGKILL and the execution retried.

# NOTIFICATION SCRIPT
#
# sentinel notification-script <master-name> <script-path>
# 
# Call the specified notification script for any sentinel event that is（在WARNING以上级别事件出现后，调用特定的脚本）
# generated in the WARNING level (for instance -sdown, -odown, and so forth).
# This script should notify the system administrator via email, SMS, or any（此脚本应该通过email，sms或者其他消息系统告知管理员redis的监控系统出了问题）
# other messaging system, that there is something wrong with the monitored
# Redis systems.
#
# The script is called with just two arguments: the first is the event type（脚本需要两个参数，第一个是事件类型，第二个是事件描述）
# and the second the event description.
#
# The script must exist and be executable in order for sentinel to start if（此脚本必须存在且可以执行）
# this option is provided.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel notification-script mymaster /var/redis/notify.sh

# CLIENTS RECONFIGURATION SCRIPT
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script <master-name> <script-path>
#
# When the master changed because of a failover a script can be called时 in（在故障转移后，master变成了其他的服务器，调用此脚本可以实现基于应用的通知，通知客户端master的IP已经修改）
# order to perform application-specific tasks to notify the clients that the
# configuration has changed and the master is at a different address.
# 
# The following arguments are passed to the script:（传递给脚本的参数）
#
# <master-name> <role> <state> <from-ip> <from-port> <to-ip> <to-port>
#
# <state> is currently always "failover"
# <role> is either "leader" or "observer"
# 
# The arguments from-ip, from-port, to-ip, to-port are used to communicate
# the old address of the master and the new address of the elected slave
# (now a master).
#
# This script should be resistant to multiple invocations.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script mymaster /var/redis/reconfig.sh
